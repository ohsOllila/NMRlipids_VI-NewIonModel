Abstract = {{A new computational model for sodium chloride, the NaCl/epsilon, is
   proposed. The force field employed for the description of the NaCl is
   based on a set of radial particle particle pair potentials involving
   Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic forces. The parametrization is obtained
   by fitting the density of the crystal and the density and the dielectric
   constant of the mixture of the salt with water at a diluted solution.
   Our model shows good agreement with the experimental values for the
   density and for the surface tension of the pure system, and for the
   density, the viscosity, the diffusion, and the dielectric constant for
   the mixture with water at various molal concentrations. The NaCl/epsilon
   together with the water TIP4P/epsilon models provide a good
   approximation for studying electrolyte solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Non-polarizable models for ions and water quantitatively and
   qualitatively misrepresent the salt concentration dependence of water
   diffusion in electrolyte solutions. In particular, experiment shows that
   the water diffusion coefficient increases in the presence of salts of
   low charge density (e.g., CsI), whereas the results of simulations with
   non-polarizable models show a decrease of the water diffusion
   coefficient in all alkali halide solutions. We present a simple
   charge-scaling method based on the ratio of the solvent dielectric
   constants from simulation and experiment. Using an ion model that was
   developed independently of a solvent, i.e., in the crystalline solid,
   this method improves the water diffusion trends across a range of water
   models. When used with a good-quality water model, e. g., TIP4P/2005 or
   E3B, this method recovers the qualitative behaviour of the water
   diffusion trends. The model and method used were also shown to give good
   results for other structural and dynamic properties including solution
   density, radial distribution functions, and ion diffusion coefficients.

Abstract = {{Ionic liquids have been intensively studied during the last decade, but
   many questions still remain unresolved. From the computational side
   there is the lack of good transferable force fields for molecular
   simulations that would allow accurate theoretical predictions and
   interpretations of the properties of ionic liquids. Within this article
   a method is described that allows for the derivation of partial charges
   for ionic liquids since they play a particular important role,
   particularly for a liquid that consists entirely of ions. Our partial
   charges are carefully determined in such a way that they incorporate in
   an average way the influence of polarization effects of the neighboring
   ions in a bulk situation thereby reducing the total ionic charge to
   values less than one. When combined with our recently introduced method
   for the optimization of the short-range interactions {[}1] we have a
   well described route to develop generic force fields for ionic liquids.
   In this article we describe our results for the partial charges for the
   three imidazolium based liquids {[}MMIM](+), {[}EMIM](+), and
   {[}BMIM](+) for three different anions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

abstract  ="Adsorption of metal cations onto a cellular membrane changes its properties{,} such as interactions with charged moieties or the propensity for membrane fusion. It is{,} however{,} unclear whether cells can regulate ion adsorption and the related functions via locally adjusting their membrane composition. We employed fluorescence techniques and computer simulations to determine how the presence of cholesterol-a key molecule inducing membrane heterogeneity-affects the adsorption of sodium and calcium onto zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine bilayers. We found that the transient adsorption of sodium is dependent on the number of phosphatidylcholine head groups{,} while the strong surface binding of calcium is determined by the available surface area of the membrane. Cholesterol thus does not affect sodium adsorption and only plays an indirect role in modulating the adsorption of calcium by increasing the total surface area of the membrane. These observations also indicate how lateral lipid heterogeneity can regulate various ion-induced processes including adsorption of peripheral proteins{,} nanoparticles{,} and other molecules onto membranes."}

@article{Verstraelen2013,
abstract = {For the development of ab initio derived force fields, atomic charges must be computed from electronic structure computations, such that (i) they accurately describe the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and (ii) they are transferable to the force-field application of interest. The Iterative Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-I or HI) scheme meets both requirements for organic molecules. For inorganic oxide clusters, however, Hirshfeld-I becomes ambiguous because electron densities of nonexistent isolated anions are needed as input. Herein, we propose a simple Extended Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-E or HE) scheme to overcome this limitation. The performance of the new HE scheme is compared to four popular atoms-in-molecules schemes, using two tests involving a set of 248 silica clusters. These tests show that the new HE scheme provides an improved trade-off between the ESP accuracy and the transferability of the charges. The new scheme is a generalization of the Hirshfeld-I scheme, and it is expected that its improvements are to a large extent applicable to molecular systems containing elements from the entire periodic table.},

We define an object function of fitting as an integration of the difference of electrostatic potentials in the entire 3-dimensional physical space. The object function is thus rotationally invariant with respect to the molecular orientation and varies smoothly with respect to molecular geometric fluctuations. Compared with commonly employed methods such as the Merz−Singh−Kollman and CHELPG schemes, this new method, while possessing comparable accuracy, shows greatly improved numerical stability with respect to the molecular positions and geometries. The method can be used in the fitting of electrostatic potentials for the molecular mechanics force fields and also can be applied to the calculation of electrostatic polarizabilites of molecular or atomic systems.},

@article{RESP_paper,
abstract = {We present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system.},

Inclusion of the self-energy correction with a consequent reparametrization of the SPC (simple point charge) model of water yields an improvement of the effective pair potential for water, as exemplified by density, radial distribution functions, and diffusion constant.},

abstract = {A potential model intended to be a general purpose model for the condensed phases of water is presented. TIP4P/2005 is a rigid four site model which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40 000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7×10−4 g/cm3.},

@article{Izadi16,
abstract = {Classical 3-point rigid water models are most widely used due to their computational efficiency. Recently, we introduced a new approach to constructing classical rigid water models [S. Izadi et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 5, 3863 (2014)], which permits a virtually exhaustive search for globally optimal model parameters in the sub-space that is most relevant to the electrostatic properties of the water molecule in liquid phase. Here we apply the approach to develop a 3-point Optimal Point Charge (OPC3) water model. OPC3 is significantly more accurate than the commonly used water models of same class (TIP3P and SPCE) in reproducing a comprehensive set of liquid bulk properties, over a wide range of temperatures. Beyond bulk properties, we show that OPC3 predicts the intrinsic charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) of water—a characteristic dependence of hydration free energy on the sign of the solute charge — in very close agreement with experiment. Two other recent 3-point rigid water models, TIP3PFB and H2ODC, each developed by its own, completely different optimization method, approach the global accuracy optimum represented by OPC3 in both the parameter space and accuracy of bulk properties. Thus, we argue that an accuracy limit of practical 3-point rigid non-polarizable models has effectively been reached; remaining accuracy issues are discussed.},

@article{Izadi14,
abstract = {Simplified, classical models of water are an integral part of atomistic molecular simulations, especially in biology and chemistry where hydration effects are critical. Yet, despite several decades of effort, these models are still far from perfect. Presented here is an alternative approach to constructing point charge water models - currently, the most commonly used type. In contrast to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry constraints on the model other than symmetry. Instead, we optimize the distribution of point charges to best describe the "electrostatics" of the water molecule, which is key to many unusual properties of liquid water. The search for the optimal charge distribution is performed in 2D parameter space of key lowest multipole moments of the model, to find best fit to a small set of bulk water properties at room temperature. A virtually exhaustive search is enabled via analytical equations that relate the charge distribution to the multipole moments. The resulting "optimal" 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model (OPC) reproduces a comprehensive set of bulk water properties significantly more accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error relative to experiment is 0.76{\%}. Close agreement with experiment holds over a wide range of temperatures, well outside the ambient conditions at which the fit to experiment was performed. The improvements in the proposed water model extend beyond bulk properties: compared to the common rigid models, predicted hydration free energies of small molecules in OPC water are uniformly closer to experiment, root-mean-square error {\textless} 1kcal/mol.},

abstract = {Neutron scattering experiments were performed on 6 m LiCl solutions in order to obtain the solvation structure around the chloride ion. Molecular dynamics simulations on systems mirroring the concentrated electrolyte conditions of the experiment were carried out with a variety of chloride force-fields. In each case the simulations were run with both full ionic charges and employing the electronic continuum correction (implemented through charge scaling) to account effectively for electronic polarisation. The experimental data were then used to assess the successes and shortcomings of the investigated force-fields. We found that due to the very good signal-to-noise ratio in the experimental data, they provide a very narrow window for the position of the first hydration shell of the chloride ion. This allowed us to establish the importance of effectively accounting for electronic polarisation, as well as adjusting the ionic size, for obtaining a force-field which compares quantitatively to the experimental ...},

    abstract = { We have developed the IPolQ method for fitting nonpolarizable point charges to implicitly represent the energy of polarization for systems in pure water. The method involves iterative cycles of molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the water charge density around the solute of interest, followed by quantum mechanical calculations at the MP2/cc-pV(T+d)Z level to determine updated solute charges. Lennard-Jones parameters are updated starting from the Amber FF99SB nonbonded parameter set to accommodate the new charge model, guided by the comparisons to experimental hydration free energies (HFEs) of neutral amino acid side chain analogs and assumptions about the computed HFEs for charged side chains. These Lennard-Jones parameter adjustments for side-chain analogs are assumed to be transferable to amino acids generally, and new charges for all standard amino acids are then derived in the presence of water modeled by TIP4P-Ew. Overall, the new charges depict substantially more polarized amino acids, particularly in the backbone moieties, than previous Amber charge sets. Efforts to complete a new force field with appropriate torsion parameters for this charge model are underway. The IPolQ method is general and applicable to arbitrary solutes. }

abstract = {This paper presents recent advances in the use of molecular simulations and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, which enable us to understand solvated ions in solution. We report and discuss the EXAFS spectra and related properties governing solvation processes of different ions in water and methanol. Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories are coupled to electron scattering simulations to generate the MD-EXAFS spectra, which are found to be in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. From these simulated spectra, the ion-oxygen distances for the first hydration shell are in agreement with experiment within 0.05-0.1 A. The ionic species studied range from monovalent to divalent, positive and negative: K+, Ca2+, and Cl-. This work demonstrates that the combination of MD-EXAFS and the corresponding experimental measurement provides a powerful tool in the analysis of the solvation structure of aqueous ionic solutions. We also investigate the value of electronic structure analysis of small aqueous clusters as a benchmark to the empirical potentials. In a novel computational approach, we determine the Debye-Waller factors for Ca2+, K+, and Cl- in water by combining the harmonic analysis of data obtained from electronic structure calculations on finite ion-water clusters, providing excellent agreement with the experimental values, and discuss how they compare with results from a harmonic classical statistical mechanical analysis of an empirical potential.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to examine the solvation properties and the ion-solvation shell exchange process of the K+ ion in liquid water, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. The solvent molecules are found to form well-defined solvation shells around the K+ ion and show a preferred orientational order toward the ion. The induced dipole moment distribution of K+ becomes broader and shifts to a larger average value from chloroform to carbon tetrachloride to water. It is observed that the K+ ion diffuses more rapidly in the aqueous phase than in liquid chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. We have also evaluated both ion and first solvent shell velocity autocorrelation functions and the residence time autocorrelation functions for the ion in water, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. The residence time is found to be 9.4 ps for water and about 30 ps for both chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. By use of a constrained molecular dynamics technique, the first solvation shell exchange process is investigated. It is found that an estimate using equilibrium solvation and classical transition-state theory overestimates the dissociation rate of the K+ ion. Including the dynamical effects using Grote?Hynes theory yields more accurate dissociation rates.

abstract = {Earlier, using phenomenological approach, we showed that in some cases polarizable models of condensed phase systems can be reduced to nonpolarizable equivalent models with scaled charges. Examples of such systems include ionic liquids, TIPnP-type models of water, protein force fields, and others, where interactions and dynamics of inherently polarizable species can be accurately described by nonpolarizable models. To describe electrostatic interactions, the effective charges of simple ionic liquids are obtained by scaling the actual charges of ions by a factor of 1/√($\epsilon$(el)), which is due to electronic polarization screening effect; the scaling factor of neutral species is more complicated. Here, using several theoretical models, we examine how exactly the scaling factors appear in theory, and how, and under what conditions, polarizable Hamiltonians are reduced to nonpolarizable ones. These models allow one to trace the origin of the scaling factors, determine their values, and obtain important insights on the nature of polarizable interactions in condensed matter systems.},

abstract = {Electronic polarizability is an important factor in molecular interactions. In the conventional force fields such as AMBER or CHARMM, however, there is inconsistency in how the effect of electronic dielectric screening of Coulombic interactions, inherent for the condensed phase media, is treated. Namely, the screening appears to be accounted for via effective charges only for neutral moieties, whereas the charged residues are treated as if they were in a vacuum. As a result, the electrostatic interactions between ionized groups are exaggerated in molecular simulations by a factor of about 2. The model discussed here, MDEC (Molecular Dynamics in Electronic Continuum) provides a theoretical framework for modification of the standard nonpolarizable force fields to make them consistent with the idea of uniform electronic screening of partial atomic charges. The present theory states that the charges of ionized groups and ions should be scaled, i.e., reduced by a factor of about 0.7. In several examples, including the interaction between Na+ ions, which is of interest for ion-channel simulations, and the dynamics of an important salt bridge in cytochrome c oxidase, we compared the standard nonpolarizable MD simulations with MDEC simulations and demonstrated that the MDEC charge scaling procedure results in more accurate interactions. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged moieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can give rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional nonpolarizable force fields simulations. Electronic polarizability is an important factor in molecular interactions. In the conventional force fields such as AMBER or CHARMM, however, there is inconsistency in how the effect of electronic dielectric screening of Coulombic interactions, inherent for the condensed phase media, is treated.

Citation:
In the uniform dielectric, all electrostatic interactions are scaled by a factor 1/$\epsilon$el. Since interactions are quadratic in charges, the effect of electronic dielectric screening can be taken into account implicitly by using scaled partial charges, qieff = qi/√$\epsilon$el; in this case, the Coulomb interaction between sites i and j automatically has the correct form qieff qjeff/rij = qiqj/$\epsilon$elrij without explicitly introducing factor 1/$\epsilon$el},

@article{leontyev09,
abstract = {A simple model for accounting for electronic polarization in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is discussed. In this model, called molecular dynamics electronic continuum (MDEC), the electronic polarization is treated explicitly in terms of the electronic continuum (EC) approximation, while the nuclear dynamics is described with a fixed-charge force field. In such a force-field all atomic charges are scaled to reflect the screening effect by the electronic continuum. The MDEC model is rather similar but not equivalent to the standard nonpolarizable force-fields; the differences are discussed. Of our particular interest is the calculation of the electrostatic part of solvation energy using standard nonpolarizable MD simulations. In a low-dielectric environment, such as protein, the standard MD approach produces qualitatively wrong results. The difficulty is in mistreatment of the electronic polarizability. We show how the results can be much improved using the MDEC approach. We also show how the dielectric constant of the medium obtained in a MD simulation with nonpolarizable force-field is related to the static (total) dielectric constant, which includes both the nuclear and electronic relaxation effects. Using the MDEC model, we discuss recent calculations of dielectric constants of alcohols and alkanes, and show that the MDEC results are comparable with those obtained with the polarizable Drude oscillator model. The applicability of the method to calculations of dielectric properties of proteins is discussed.},

abstract = { The Amber Lipid14 force field is expanded to include cholesterol parameters for all-atom cholesterol and lipid bilayer molecular dynamics simulations. The General Amber and Lipid14 force fields are used as a basis for assigning atom types and basic parameters. A new RESP charge derivation for cholesterol is presented, and tail parameters are adapted from Lipid14 alkane tails. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers are simulated at a range of cholesterol contents. Experimental bilayer structural properties are compared with bilayer simulations and are found to be in good agreement. With this parameterization, another component of complex membranes is available for molecular dynamics with the Amber Lipid14 force field. },

abstract="In many technical and natural phenomena, adsorption at the interface actually takes place when the bulk solution adjacent to the interface contains several solute components. The organic and inorganic solutes present in the bulk may be nonelectrolytes or electrolytes, so that the solution also contains ionic and nonionic species of solutes. The aqueous solvent on slight dissociation may also introduce H+ and OH− in the bulk system. The organic solutes in the bulk system are usually surface-active, so that most of the time they accumulate in the interfacial phase as positive excesses. In the absence of organic solute, inorganic salts usually accumulate at the interface as negative excesses. But in the presence of organic amphiphiles, the inorganic cations and anions may accumulate either as negative or positive excesses depending upon the nature of the surface charge in the so-called interfacial double layer.",
