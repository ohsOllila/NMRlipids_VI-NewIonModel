\section{Electronic continuum correction applied to CHARMM36 model}
In order to demonstrate that the ECC method can be applied also to other models than Lipid14,
we scaled the charges and Lennard-Jones radii of headgroup, glycerol backbone and
carbonyl atoms of the CHARMM36 model of POPC~\cite{klauda10}. We used the
scaling factors optimized for Lipid14 in the main text, i.e., 0.8 for charges and 0.89 for Lennard-Jones
radii. Changes of the headgroup order parameters as functions of added ions
and number density profiles along membrane normal from the ECC-CHARMM model are shown 
in Figs. \ref{scaledCHARMM} and \ref{scaledCHARMMdensity}, respectively,
together with the results from CHARMM36 simulations \cite{catte16,charmmPOPC450mMCaClfiles}
and experiments \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}. As shown previously \cite{catte16},
the binding of Ca$^{2+}$ is significantly overestimated in CHARMM36 simulations.
In ECC-CHARMM simulations, the Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity 
is significantly reduced (Fig. \ref{scaledCHARMMdensity}) and the headgroup order parameter response to the added CaCl$_2$
is in a better agreement with experiments than for the original CHARMM model (Fig. \ref{scaledCHARMM}).
In line with the results in main text,
Fig. \ref{scaledCHARMMcontacts} also shows faster equilibration times
for Ca$^{2+}$ binding in the ECC-CHARMM model than in the original CHARMM36.

In conclusion, applying ECC to CHARMM36 simulation
improved the ion binding affinity to a lipid bilayer, even thought the
scaling factors optimized for Lipid14 were used. Also the area per molecule in
the ECC-CHARMM simulation without ions (61 $\AA^2$) is only slightly
lower than the experimental value (64.3 $\AA^2$) \cite{kucerka11}. 
The optimal scaling factors for CHARMM36 are expected to be somewhat different
than for Lipid14 because the initial partial charges are not the same
in different models. Our results indicate that the performance of ion
binding in ECC-CHARMM36, and probably in other lipid models as well, could
be further improved by finding the optimal scaling factors for the partial
charges and Lennard-Jones radii.

It should be noted that the calcium binding to POPC bilayer within the ECC-CHARMM model
is compared here to the CHARMM36 simulation, which was originally done in a 
previous study \cite{catte16,charmmPOPC450mMCaClfiles}.
After the latter simulation has been performed, specific interaction parameters
between calcium and oxygen \cite{kim16} have been introduced in CHARMM-gui
to reduce the binding of calcium to lipid bilayers. These parameters
reduce the calcium binding to a POPC bilayer to the same level as that of sodium (data not shown).
Further analyses of ion binding with different parameters (including the newly modified CHARMM) are in progress
within the NMRlipids IV project (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}), being beyond the scope of this work.

\section{Ternary complex model in simulations}
The NMR data about PC headgroup order parameters
and atomic absorption spectroscopy data were previously
best explained using a ternary complex binding model~\cite{altenbach84}.
In this model, one calcium is assumed to form
complexes with two lipids, i.e. with the binding stoichiometry of~1~\ce{Ca^{2+}}:2~POPC.
The model predicts a linear relationship between quantities 
$C_b$ and $\sqrt{C_b/C_I}$, where $C_b$ is the
mole fraction of bound \ce{Ca^{2+}} per POPC
and $C_I$ is the concentration of free cations at the plane of ion binding~\cite{altenbach84}.
Experimentally detemined $C_b$ %was obtained from an extrapolation of linear relation 
from NMR measurements and atomic absorption spectroscopy %for low concetrations of \ce{CaCl2}.
%Such an extrapolation is valid as long as the mode of \ce{Ca^{2+}} binding 
%remains constant throughout the extrapolation range. 
together with $C_I$ calculated from the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
gave a good agreement with the predictions of the
ternary complex model~\cite{altenbach84}.

To compare ECC-POPC simulations to the ternary complex model,
%An atomistic simulation, on the other hand, provides these quantities directly without severe assumptions;
we calculated $C_b$ from simulations (as defined in the main text),
and $C_I$ from the minimum CaCl$_2$ concentration at membrane-water interface,
%the shallow depression separating the bulk water phase 
locating around 2.6\,nm from the membrane center in
the density profiles in Fig.~5 in the main text. 

The results from simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-bind}
together with the line fitted to experimental data by Altenbach and Seelig~\cite{altenbach84}.
Both results are in agreement with the prediction of the ternary complex model.
The small discrepancy between the results from experiments and simulations probably
arise from difference in the evaluation of the concentrations and
inaccuracy of Poisson-Boltzmann theory for divalent cations like \ce{Ca^{2+}}~\cite{Andelman1995}. 
In conclusion, the results suggest that the almost equal probabilities for
\ce{Ca^{2+}} to form complexes with one to three lipids detailed in the main text is in line with an averaged interpretation of the experimental observations which supported the ternary complex model.

    %Ternary complex binding model of \ce{Ca^{2+}} to a POPC membrane 
    %that assumes the stoichiometry of 2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}} (details in reference~\citenum{altenbach84}) 
    %provides a good fit to experimental measurements~\cite{altenbach84}
    %and it also provides a good fit to our simulation data. 
    %This supports our statement that the success of the ternary complex model in the experiments
    %can be understood with the atomistic detail of our simulations as an average 
    %stoichiometry of otherwise almost evenly distributed clusters of one cation with 1,2 or 3 lipids (Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}). 
    %Note that the units in the reference~\citenum{altenbach84} are different from the units presented here,
    %and, hence, the observed slope of the linear relationship is slightly different.

   Histograms of residence times of \ce{Ca^{2+}} in a POPC bilayer
   from ECC-POPC (top) and CHARMM36 (bottom) simulations with ECC-ions.
   Both simulations had the same concentration of \ce{CaCl_2} respect to water ($C_{ion}'$= 450~mM).
   CHARMM36 simulation was directly taken from Refs.~\citenum{javanainen17,zenodo.259376}.
   Scales of x-axes represent the lengths of the simulations used for analysis.
   In ECC-POPC simulation, 90\% of the residence times are
   shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$                                                                          
   with the longest observed residence time being $141\,\mathrm{ns}$,
   which is well below the total length of the simulation (200~ns).
   This is, however not the case in CHARMM36 simulation,
   where residence times of several calcium cations are    
   apparently limited by the length of the simulation.
   %With such a simulation, which is relatively short for the employed model,
   %we can merely estimate an upper bound that
   %only
   Less than 60\% of the residence times are
   %is formed by cations interacting with the phospholipid membrane
   shorter than the half of the simulation length~(400~ns)

    In consistent with figure 5 in the main text, the density profiles of ions and water
    are divided with 2 and 200, respectively. Similarity of potassium
    and chloride curves together with the bulk concentrations indicate lower binding 
    affinity for potassium than for sodium (Fig. 5 in the main text).
    Since this is in line with wide range of experimental data \cite{eisenberg79,binder02,klasczyk10}, we conclude
    that the ECC-POPC model reproduces the correct binding affinity also for potassium.
    In line with the low binding affinity, the headgroup order parameters were not
    affected by the presense of KCl in simulations. The order parameter 
    data is not shown because we are not aware of experimental data for PC headgroup
    order parameters as a function of KCl concentration.
